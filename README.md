# Nx Example: Shared Lib

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/nx-logo.png">


Shared library containing one component. 

It can be developed and published independently. Run `yarn compile` to get the compiled version of the library in the `dist` folder.

It can also be used as a part of the parent multirepo project (see here [https://github.com/nrwl/nx-example-multirepo](https://github.com/nrwl/nx-example-multirepo)).
